1.	Who we are and what’s the idea?
Creating an application aimed at people with memory dysfunctions caused by various reasons. Its main goals are to assist the affected people in their everyday routine, help monitor the progress of the condition, help decelerate the deterioration of the condition by way of introducing gamified memory exercises, and ultimately improve the quality of life of both the patients and their families.

2.	Why should we care?
•	According to the Alzheimer’s disease researches (1), there are over 9.9 million new cases of dementia each year worldwide, implying one new case every 3.2 seconds. Specifically in Nordic countries (2), there are around half a million people who have been diagnosed with dementia, and it has been estimated to go almost double over the next 35 years. These numbers include only those people who have been diagnosed with dementia, and do not account for the large amount of people with undiagnosed dementia. 
•	Although seniors consistently have lower rates of technology adoption than the general public, nowadays this group is more digitally connected than ever - 67% of adults in US (3) aged 65 and older say they go online, and this number is constantly growing. Therefore, society needs a modern digital solution for this old problem.
•	Considering that there is a growing awareness of dementia cases that start before the age of 65 (4), we all should realize that dementia is not a problem of certain individuals, it’s a problem of their caring family and the society as a whole. 

3.	What is the uniqueness?
Based on our research, there are limited amount of applications for people with dementia.
For example, there are applications (5) that can help to check date and time, find the location, schedule the taking of medication, have a brain training session in a game format, etc. 

A unique feature of our application is the option for patients to speak aloud, recording their thoughts and making audio notes. Why is it important for people with dementia to make voice records? 

•	Firstly, according to recent study (University of Waterloo, 2017(6)) speaking aloud helps to get information into long-term memory. The study determined that it is the dual action of speaking and hearing oneself that has the most beneficial impact on memory. 
•	Secondly, as our application also could be useful for senior people, it will be easier for them to record voice instead of typing information using mobile phone keyboard. However, for those who want to have information in text form, there’s an option to use a speech-to-text recognition function that automatically transfers voice record to text file and saves it.
